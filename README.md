## Installation

To use The Automated Graphic Designer, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Follow these steps to install and set up the application:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd The-Automated-Graphic-Designer
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command in your terminal:

```
node index.js
```

You will be prompted to enter the following information:
- **Up to three characters for the logo text**
- **The text color** (either as a color keyword or a hexadecimal number)
- **A shape for the logo** (circle, triangle, or square)
- **The shape color** (either as a color keyword or a hexadecimal number)

Once you've entered the information, the application will generate an SVG file named `logo.svg` and save it in the `examples` folder.

│   └── shapes.test.js  // Jest tests for shapes
├── .gitignore          // Indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js            // Runs the application using imports from lib/
